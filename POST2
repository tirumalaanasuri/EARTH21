Introduction to the planet “The Earth”

Earth is an integral part of the solar system. It gets heat and light from the sun. If you look at the globe, most of the surface is covered with water i.e. approximately 71%. The rest 29% is covered by lands. Among this 71% water, only 3% is fresh water and the rest 97% is salted water of oceans and seas.

The Earth is surrounded by 6 layers known as its atmosphere. Earth’s atmospheric layers are- troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere, and ionosphere. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of various gases like nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.97%) and CO2 (0.04%), water vapor, etc.

Origin of the Earth

The origin of the Earth is believed to be almost 5000 to 6000 million years ago. The Earth came into existence in the form of condensed cloud and other gases. The Earth was made up of mainly iron and silicate and some other elements in its origin. Some of these elements were radioactive.

After millions of years from its origin, the Earth becomes hotter and hotter due to continuous energy release through radioactive decay. As a result, the iron started melting and eventually, it reaches the center. Finally, the iron accumulated at the core of the Earth.

Composition of the Earth

The Earth is covered with gaseous material known as the Earth’s atmosphere. We live under this atmosphere on the surface of the Earth. Earth is composed of a number of layers. The kids for class 3 to 6 can get the answer for the composition of the Earth here. They can further add it to the earth essay. The different layers of the Earth are as follows-

Crust

The crust is the outer layer or surface of the Earth where we live. The Earth’s crust is a thin layer as compared to other layers. The Earth’s crust is approximately 5 km thick in ocean bed and almost 70 km thick in the continents.  The crust layer of the land or the continents is composed of silica & alumina, hence called “sial”.

Mantle

The next layer under Earth’s crust is known as the mantle. This layer is quite thick as compared to Earth’s crust, approximately 3000 km in depth. Mantle layer is composed of different silicate rocks consisting more of magnesium and iron.

Tectonic plates

This layer of Earth is quite sensitive. Tectonic plates are actually a kind of combination of both the Earth’s crust and outer mantle layer which is commonly known as the lithosphere. When there is any kind of tension created through the movements of these plates, it leads to natural disaster i.e. earthquake.
